## The Odin Project - Blog App

First Rails project. Create a simple blog using Rails.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Rails
 - Ruby
 - ERB
 - HTML
 - SQLite3
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github

## What I learned:
 - How to create a simple CRUD application on Rails
 - MVC - Model-View-Controller pattern
 - How to create, read, update, and delete blog posts
 - How to create comments as a second model
 - Generating models, database migrations, building forms, validations and error messages, model associations
 - Using partials

 
## Still can improve:
 - This is an extremely simple blog application, need to get more familiar with Rails to make more advanced applications
